# Data-Engineering-for-YOLOv8-High-Jump-Motion-Classification
This project builds a data-centric computer-vision pipeline for recognizing the three phases of a high-jump attempt (Run, Jump, Land) using a YOLOv8 model. We created a custom dataset by collecting high-jump videos, extracting frames, and performing all labeling, augmentation, and dataset management through Roboflow.
